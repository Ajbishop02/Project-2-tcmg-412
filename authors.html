    <h2>Lizey</h2>
    <p class="txt">My name is Lizey Rowden. I'm studying Technology Management with a minor in cybersecurity
        and a minor in business graduating in May 2023. On September 23rd, I'm getting my Aggie Ring,
        and I'm so excited. I have a cat named Amos who was adopted a little over a year ago - he's the
        best. I have two sisters - all three of us have attended TAMU. Some of my hobbies include
        working out, hanging out with friends and family, and learning new things.</p>

        <p class="txt">Howdy! My name is Braden Alexander, and I am a member of the Class of 2023, majoring in
            Technology Management with a minor in Business and Cybersecurity. I am from Jacksonville,
            Texas which is in the East Texas area about 20 minutes south of Tyler, Texas. I am a
            programming director for the Applet Aggieland Visitor Center on campus. So I give tours and do
            some overnight events that high schools come down to learn more about our great university. I
            am also a member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band on the Bugle Rank so look out for me at the
            front rank of the band at halftime! </p>
